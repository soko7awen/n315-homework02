# Ouroboros

The Ouroboros or uroborus is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. Ouroboros is also a font for alchemists, witches, heretics, outsiders and curious people in general. It's inspired by early art-nouveau styles, which were sometimes used in relation with magical themes and symbolism, so it comes together with a set of alchemical and astronomical symbols.

The 2019 update of Ouroboros, called Protean, contains several new features. The font now fully supports Vietnamese. It also has a basic Cyrillic set, with additional Ukrainian, Serbian and Macedonian support, and some historical forms (as suggested by Cyrillic users). The alchemical set has been completed and fully reviewed for improved contrast, proportions and kerning. Some other symbols have been added, such as a full zodiac set. Spacing and kerning has been improved, making it subtly more relaxed. More than one hundred ligatures have been set as default (they were previously discretionary ligatures), making Ouroboros more versatile and changing than ever.

In 2021, Ouroboros was updated again, the main changes were the clean-up of some curves and the adition of some symbols proposed by artist Hélène Mourrier. Ouroboros will continue to evolve in the future with (even more) queer and alternative-culture symbols.
