FONTLOG for BackOut
-------------------
This file provides detailed information on the BackOut font software.
This information should be distributed along with the BACKOUT fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------
BackOut is a humanistic incise typeface. It has a heavily modular aspect but optic corrections have been performed on closed letters, arrows and other glyphs. Please keep that in mind when designing new glyphs :)


Information for Contributors

BackOut is released under the OFL 1.1 - http://scripts.sil.org/OFL
For information on what you're allowed to change or modify, consult the
OFL-1.1.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt files. The OFL-FAQ also gives a very general
rationale and various recommendations regarding why you would want to
contribute to the project or make your own version of the font.
